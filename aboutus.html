                    <h3 class="guide-name">Pete Wallstrom</h3>
                    <p class="pspec">Pete is originally from Vermont but has spent time living in Colorado, Wyoming, South America, and on the West Coast. He has been a guide for over 20 years and has run rivers all over the United States – including the Upper Tuolumne (Cherry Creek) in California, considered the toughest regularly-run commercial trip in North America – as well as rivers in Nepal, India, Costa Rica, Panama, Argentina, and Chile. He is a board member for the Oregon Guides and Outfitters Association, the Save the Wild Rogue Campaign, the Rogue Outfitters Association, and works closely with the Southern Oregon University Outdoor Adventure Leadership Program as well as with environmental groups that work towards the protection of wild rivers. Besides boating he is an avid back-country skier, boarder, runner, and general outdoor adventurer.

                    <h3 class="guide-name">Alyssa Warren</h3>
                    <p class="pspec">Alyssa is one of our true native Southern Oregonians. She has been running rivers since she was 8, discovered her passion for guiding at the age of 18 and has been guiding in the Pacific Northwest ever since. She has worked on the Middle Fork of the Salmon in Idaho and the Colorado River through Grand Canyon as well as all of our rivers. Alyssa has a Bachelor’s Degree in Art (painting) and a minor in Geology, which she blames on her years on the river. She is now the Clean Water Campaigner for Rogue River Keeper and during her spare time you can usually find her in the mountains, in the rivers or painting. Despite being the Rogue River Keeper she still finds time to guide here and on the Grand. She is a Sagittarius, enjoys a good IPA, her favorite food is Italian and she will gladly challenge anyone to a friendly game of Butt Darts.

                    <h3 class="guide-name">Tyler Pohle</h3>
                    <p class="pspec">Tyler is another one of our Wisconsin natives. He has been a river guide for over 10 years and has guided rivers in Colorado, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Oregon, California, Idaho, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Guatemala. When not on the river, Tyler can be found guiding backcountry snowboarding trips, climbing, biking, surfing, sailing, and hiking. He was the manager of his last company in Colorado and now has the tricky job of managing a bunch of guides who have all been managers. Tyler has been known to freak people out with his quick changes from a guide/mountain man to Portland hipster and if we were to start a Momentum Calendar he would probably be voted for the cover. Little known fact about Tyler: He almost decided to become a lawyer instead of a river guide.
